## Analysis on Device Preference of Customers using Linear Regression

**Background of the Project:**
It's a project about an E-commerce company that sells clothing online. The company sells its products through website and app. While many customers prefer to purchase their products from website, others like to use the app. But the company has limited resource and money to invest on a particular platform. So, it is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 

**Work Process:**
I have collected the data of 1000 customers of that company. After that, I have imported necessary python libraries for this project. Using those libraries, I have performed an exploratory data analysis on the data through various visual representations. Then I have split the data into train and test sets. After training the model, I have conducted Linear Regression which eventually helped me to evaluate the model and predict the test data. Finally, I have determined the coefficients of the independent variables of the dataset. 

**Result:**
I have explored the relationship between the variables of the data and gained some knowledge about the company, its business and customers. Then finally, I have provided my decision on to develop the preferred platform further.

*Note: The company information, dataset and the final decision of the project are confidential. I have only shown the data analysis process.*
